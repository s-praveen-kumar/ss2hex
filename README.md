# ss2hex
Spreadsheet to Hex file.
This spreadsheet allows us to write code in Binary (yes, binary instructions) and have them converted into hex file automatically. It does so using formulas on a second sheet and doesn't use any macros.
Created as a demonstration.

Note: The compatability with MS Excel is not fully verified. This was created and works well with LibreOffice Calc
